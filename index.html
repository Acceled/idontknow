An estimated 50-80% of life on Earth is located under the surface of the oceans. The oceans contain 99% of the living space on the planet. And humans have only explored less than 10% of that space. Not only that, but the oceans account for 96% of all the water on the surface of the Earth. And the remainder? It's all fresh water in the form of rivers, lakes and ice. At the same time, the ocean absorbs about 25% of the CO2 emitted into the atmosphere from human activities each year. This greatly reduces the impact of greenhouse gas on the climate. The ocean sure is incredible and full of wonder.</div></div></div>
